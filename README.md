Created using Cleanfolio minimal by rjskhr (see links below). I updated the colors, added my own personal logo, changed links and other small design choices. As of now this project is complete but I am considering adding a table or other page with a full list of all projects I have worked on. 

Thanks again to rjshkhr, go check out his template and work.
